# KLG AI OS — Changelog

Three agents collaborate on this project. Each entry is tagged by who did the work:

- **[Backend]** — Claude Code (VS Code) — API, Python, Notion bridge, scheduler, auth, security
- **[Frontend]** — Antigravity — UI design, components, CSS, mobile layout, design system
- **[Manager]** — Claude Desktop — architecture decisions, cross-agent coordination, specs

Entries without a tag are mixed-agent or pre-multi-agent-setup commits.

## 2026-08-20

- **[Frontend]** Compact Matters panels now switch exclusively between Tasks and Details, eliminating the cramped split view and competing scroll regions on small screens.

## 2026-08-19

- **[Frontend]** Responsive Matters detail workspace: short-height and narrow screens now default to a task-first view with collapsible matter metadata, a guaranteed usable task area, sticky task controls, dynamic viewport handling, and mobile-sized touch targets.

## 2026-08-07

- **[Backend]** `_normalize_matter()` now includes `in_briefing_portal: bool` — checks whether the matter's Team Portals relation includes the "📁 KLG Briefing Projects" portal (`36e0fc06-a06c-80e3-91b8-fba0a5a6912f`). `_BRIEFING_PROJECTS_PORTAL_ID` constant defined in `api/routes/alfred.py`; `in_briefing_portal?: boolean` added to the `Matter` TypeScript type. Prerequisite for the Deadlines tab portal-scope split (frontend work separate).
- **[Backend]** P0 hotfix: `_PROP_COURT_DEADLINE` updated from `"Next Court Deadline"` → `"❌Next Court Deadline"` to match the live Notion property rename. Two files that bypassed the constant (`agents/deadline_watch.py`, `api/routes/slack.py`) now use it. `/alfred/chat` deadline queries and the daily Deadline Watch Slack post were returning 500 / APIResponseError.
- **[Backend]** Revert Project Status fallback in `_is_active_or_hold()` and `statusKey()` — spot-check found the 44 surfaced matters are mostly stale (e.g. Palmieri oral argument, finished 2 months ago, still shows `Project Status: In progress`). Under-counting beats active misleading. `/alfred/matters` returns to ~48. `project_status` field kept in payload and `Matter` type for triage use.
- **[Backend]** Case-type task rubric (William's decision table, 8/5): new `alfred/task_rubric.py` transcribes both task tables verbatim (27 Appellate + 19 Trial Court rows), `resolve_tasks_for_matter()` evaluates all condition keys and owner rules, `seed_from_rubric()` replaces `seed_from_template()` in `notion_bridge/tasks.py` (uses rubric output instead of the corrupted live DB), `seed_matter_tasks` tool rewritten with explicit intake-questionnaire parameters. Rules enforced: no Contingent tasks at setup; Brief Drafting owner never guessed; Ninth Circuit Compliance Checklist on Trial Court always flagged not created; Brief: Second Drafter Review skipped (not created) when Tim is the drafter; idempotency guard preserved.

## 2026-08-06

- **[Backend]** `e62e80f` — Fix 1 + Fix 2 (matter-status-fallback): `_normalize_matter()` now includes `project_status` in the API payload; `_is_active_or_hold()` falls back to Project Status's "in_progress" group (Planning/In progress/Paused) when Matter Status is blank. Surfaces the 44 previously-invisible active matters.
- **[Backend]** `dd9a8cd` — Huddle dedup by transcript ID: `_existing_transcript_id()` helper reads the Slack file ID already stored in a Comms Log entry's Transcript block; 7-day lookback re-discoveries now skip instead of creating spurious `(PM)` duplicates. Fixes 9 duplicate entries created 2026-08-03.
- **[Backend]** Fix 3 (matter-status-fallback): `project_status?: string` added to the `Matter` type; `statusKey()` in DeadlinesWorkspace falls back to Project Status (Paused → On Hold, Planning/In progress → Active) when `status` is blank. Deadlines tab now shows the previously-invisible 44 matters grouped correctly. Tagged [Backend] because this was pure logic — no design judgment — picked up from Antigravity's queue.

## 2026-08-04

- **[Frontend]** `db6a80f` — Mobile layout, dynamic multi-view dashboard, and backend agent spec

## 2026-08-03

- **[Backend]** `3fee643` — **Hotfix (P0):** `get_all_active_matters()` was reading `"Status"` — the real Notion property is `"Matter Status"`. Silently returned zero matters to every caller (Matters tab, Deadlines tab, Alfred chat, all scheduled agents). Fixed property key + threaded `archived` param through to DB layer so `?archived=true` now works.
- **[Backend]** `4c53b0b` — Slack agents (hygiene scan, weekly agenda, case check-in) now filter to Active/On Hold matters only. Added `SLACK_HYGIENE_ENABLED` and `SLACK_CHECKIN_ENABLED` Railway flags to disable agents without deploys.
- **[Backend]** `f25d493` — Deadlines tab active filter: switched from denylist to allowlist (only explicit Active/On Hold statuses pass). Empty status no longer silently joins the Active group.
- **[Backend]** `2ff4a48` — Security audit: fixed 8 of 11 findings (security headers middleware, SSO Bearer JWT auth, SSE error masking, debug schema endpoint gating, 403 for client sessions on briefing, generic 500s on upload/deadlines, `NotionBridge()` init fix in admin routes).
- **[Manager]** Diagnosed the `get_all_active_matters()` status-key bug (reading nonexistent `"Status"` instead of `"Matter Status"`, confirmed against the live Notion schema) — wrote the hotfix spec that Backend implemented as `3fee643`.
- **[Manager]** Alfred-vs-Claude-official-Slack strategic fork: drafted a three-option memo (keep Alfred as its own app / build on Claude's official Slack integration / split by surface) for Tim's decision, after he raised it unresolved in the 7/31 huddle.
- **[Manager]** Synthesized the Alfred roadmap from the 7/31 huddle transcript, #klg-systems-development Slack history, and verified P0 bug status directly against code — surfaced two new gaps (casefile@ email pipeline has no deadline surfacing; Briefs Repository needs re-architecture) and confirmed 2 of 3 original P0 bugs already fixed.

- **[Frontend]** `e1556ee` — Matter edit failures now surface to user; assignee edits deferred to Notion with tooltip
